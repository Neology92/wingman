    # ---------------- #
    #   Action plan!   #
    # ---------------- #

    # Define mode:
    # For MVP only Mon-Fri (work-days mode)

    # Define range (how many days backwards)

    # Try to create separate repo

    # Try to create commit

    # Try to create commit for the past

    # Calculate week days

    # Create commit for every week day



    # ---------------- #
    #     Later...     #
    # ---------------- #

    # Use some github API to get only non-filled days

    # Maybe add mode for filling just "alone" days
